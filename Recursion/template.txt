Pseudo-code for a general recursive solution:

if (test for a simple case):
    Compute a simple solution without using recursion
else:
    # Divide-and-conquer or Decrease-or-conquer
    Break the problem into sub-problems of the same problem.
    Solve each of the sub-problems by calling this function recursively.
    Re-assemble the sub-problem solutions into a solution for the whole problem.
